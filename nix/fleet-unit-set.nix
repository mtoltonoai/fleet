# The fleet user-daemon set as structured data: the single source of truth consumed by BOTH the unit-file
# text generator (nix/fleet-daemons.nix) and the home-manager module (nix/fleet-daemons-hm.nix). Each record
# is the exact argument set its builder takes, tagged with `kind` (service | timer | guard). ExecStart binary
# paths and the shared watchdog env are passed in so the data carries no store path or host-specific value.
#
# The unit shape is the declarative mirror of the fleet binary's own text templates
# (crates/fleet/src/main.rs :: daemon_unit_file and watchdog_unit_files). A `kind = "service"` record is a
# long-running Type=simple daemon; `kind = "timer"` is an oneshot .service plus a .timer; `kind = "guard"`
# is a cadenza hub .claude/fleet/<script> oneshot plus a .timer (task_495). Field names match the builder
# parameters exactly; a record carries only the fields its inline form set, so builder defaults apply identically.

  # --reap-stale-observers (task_1045) stays on as the janitor: it clears leaked or straggler obs-* windows (an
  # observer that crashes/hangs before `observe-record`, or a leftover from the prior spawn cadence) and only
  # kills windows whose spawn stamp is stale/absent, so it is safe and useful without the spawn cadence.
  # --recover-wedged (task_582, cameron ENABLE): auto-recover an agent stuck in a model-safeguard refusal loop
  # (which keeps last_seen advancing, so the liveness sweep misses it) via a force spin-down + spin-up. Fenced:
  # fires only on a trailing run of stop_reason=refusal turns, per-agent 3600s cooldown, suppressed during a
  # fleet-quiesce. Cameron directed the detect-AND-restart capability (task_582) and approved enabling it here.
  # --review-sweep (task_374 S2c): the automatic adversarial-review trigger — each pass, spawn the per-angle
  # ephemeral reviewers for every review in_review + not yet vetted. Idempotent via the S2b per-angle claim (a
  # review already covered re-spawns nothing), so running it on the 60s cadence is safe; this is what makes the
  # review engine live without a manual `review-spawn`/`review-sweep` invocation.
  # --intake-watch (task_1217 enable, v-fleet-tooling comment_7017): run the project_29 dwell+state intake sweep
  # each pass and ALERT (per-offender comment + one fenced digest to the fleet-intake-watch channel), so an
  # intake task past the ~2min dwell SLA or stuck in_progress/blocked surfaces rather than piling silently. This
  # is alert-only (no destructive auto-action), already blessed by cameron's task framing, so it is a deploy not
  # a fresh operator posture. It reads the intake project from config.intake_project; absent = no-op (zero blast
  # radius), so this flag only goes live once config.intake_project = 29 is set on this host (co-applied with
  # v-nix's home-manager host-config migration). Gated like the sibling acts: board-reachable, quiesce-suppressed,
  # best-effort, logged; its per-offender + per-sweep cooldown stamps make the 60s cadence safe.
