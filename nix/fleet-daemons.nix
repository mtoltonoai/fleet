# Fleet daemons as flake-managed USER systemd units (board task #486 / #493 / task_494, operator seq-6441).
#
# The fleet host is a non-NixOS Linux distribution -> there is no nixos-rebuild and no
# NixOS-module `systemd.services`. So this flake BUILDS the fleet binary (packages.<sys>.fleet) and
# GENERATES user systemd unit files whose ExecStart points at that store binary; `install-fleet-daemons`
# installs them into ~/.config/systemd/user/ and RECONCILES -- it prunes flake-managed units the flake no
# longer defines, so the flake OWNS the managed set (seq-6441). Units run as the fleet user (no root);
# enable-linger keeps them running across logout on the headless desk.
#
# The preferred path for a home-manager host is the module in ./fleet-daemons-hm.nix (exposed as
# homeManagerModules.fleet-daemons): it maps the same unit set (./fleet-unit-set.nix) to systemd.user units a
# single `home-manager switch` owns. This text generator + install-fleet-daemons app serve a host that is not
# home-manager-managed.
#
# The unit shape is the DECLARATIVE MIRROR of the fleet binary's own text templates
# (crates/fleet/src/main.rs :: daemon_unit_file and watchdog_unit_files) -- byte-identical
# [Unit]/[Service]/[Install] sections -- plus a leading `# managed-by:` comment (systemd ignores comment
# lines) so the installer can identify and prune the managed set without a filename convention.
