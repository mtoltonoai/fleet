//! `board` — the bridge's client for the coordination board's **token-less localhost REST** surface.
//!
//! The bridge daemon runs OUTSIDE a Claude session, so it can't use the in-session board MCP tools — it uses
//! the board's plain REST API (the way the `fleet` orchestrator's `board.rs` reads `/board/api/*`). The two
//! directions this GitHub adapter drives over that surface:
//!
//! - **OUT (board → GitHub)**: subscribe to the board-wide event firehose (`GET /events?since_seq=<seq>`,
//!   append-only, ascending `seq`) and act on the authorized-reflect events (board-core #150). Per #150 the
//!   board has ALREADY applied the concierge-only OUT authz — the mere *existence* of the reflect event IS
//!   the authorization, so a later slice reflects each one it sees to the linked GitHub issue and never
//!   re-checks direction/authors. This slice lands the firehose *subscribe* (envelope + [`poll_events`]);
//!   decoding the task-comment reflect payload is the OUT-reflect slice (its exact event contract is being
//!   confirmed with v-task-board, since #150 shipped for channel posts and GitHub reflects a *task comment*).
//! - **IN (GitHub → board)**: create a mirrored board task per ingested issue (`POST /tasks`) and add
//!   attributed comments (`POST /tasks/:id/comments`) with the bridge's own agent id as author and the GitHub
//!   user as `external_author` (external-identity, board-core #149). The issue↔task and comment↔comment
//!   mapping is durably recorded in the board's generic `external_link` table (board-core #149 slice 2 /
//!   #151) so a restart is idempotent and never double-creates.
//!
//! The HTTP methods are thin wrappers over ureq; all PARSING/SHAPING is factored into pure functions
//! ([`parse_events`], [`build_task_body`], [`build_comment_body`], [`build_identity_body`]) that are
//! unit-tested without a network.
