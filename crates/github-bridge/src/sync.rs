//! `sync` — the pure ingest PLANNING, independent of the live GitHub REST + board HTTP transports.
//!
//! This is where the IN-direction (GitHub → board) *decisions* live so the daemon poll loop (a later slice)
//! stays a thin shell that just does I/O:
//!   - [`plan_issue_ingest`]: given a batch of GitHub [`Issue`]s + the issue↔task links already recorded on
//!     the board, produce the mirrored board tasks to CREATE — skipping pull requests and any issue already
//!     linked (idempotent: a re-poll of the same issue is a no-op).
//!   - [`plan_comment_ingest`]: given an issue's GitHub [`IssueComment`]s + the comment refs already synced +
//!     the bridge's own GitHub login, produce the attributed board comments to POST — skipping comments the
//!     bridge itself authored (loop-safety: an OUT-reflected comment on GitHub must not re-ingest) and any
//!     comment already synced.
//!
//! Attribution (board-core #149): a GitHub author becomes `external_author = github:<login>`, so board
//! readers see WHO wrote it, not the bridge. A ghost (deleted) author has no login, so it stays unattributed
//! (the bridge is the sole `author`) rather than fabricating an identity.
//!
//! Everything here is pure + unit-tested; the daemon feeds it what it read and executes what it returns via
//! the idempotent `board::create_task` / `board::comment_task` (each carrying the `external_link`, board-core
//! #270), so dedup is the board's job and this layer never tracks already-ingested state itself.
