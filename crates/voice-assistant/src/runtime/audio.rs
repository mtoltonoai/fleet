//! `runtime::audio` — microphone capture (cpal) with an energy VAD, and speaker playback.
//!
//! Capture mirrors the Python `record_until_silence`: pull fixed frames, RMS each one, start on the first
//! loud frame, stop after enough trailing quiet (but only once real speech has been heard), and give up if
//! nothing is said within a start window. cpal delivers audio on its own callback thread, so a frame
//! channel bridges it to the blocking VAD loop.
//!
//! Playback hands PCM to an external player (`paplay`/`pw-play`/`aplay`) — `sounddevice.play()` hung on the
//! box and cpal output has the same class of driver trouble, so the external-player path is the validated
//! one. Cue tones play a whole temp WAV ([`play_wav`], blocking); a spoken reply is STREAMED chunk-by-chunk
//! to the player's stdin as it synthesizes ([`StreamPlayer`]) so audio starts on the first chunk and the
//! loop can barge-in and kill it (#454). With `[audio].output_device` set, playback pins to a single
//! deterministic `aplay -D <device>` (bypassing player auto-selection + the ALSA `default` PCM, which is a
//! dead PipeWire sink for a session-less system service — #296).
