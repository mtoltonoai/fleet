//! `VoiceBridge` — the async board session the audio loop drives (INBOUND + OUTBOUND over `bridge-core`).
//!
//! This is the thin async I/O shell over the pure planners: it owns the [`BoardClient`], the resolved
//! [`ChannelMap`], and the persisted firehose cursor, and exposes the two operations the audio loop needs:
//!   - [`VoiceBridge::post_transcript`] (INBOUND): a finalized STT transcript -> an attributed board post
//!     (`sender` = the bridge agent, `external_author` = `voice:<speaker>`), via `bridge_core::plan_inbound`.
//!   - [`VoiceBridge::poll_replies`] (OUTBOUND): poll the firehose and return the speakable replies on the
//!     voice channel (George's turn replies AND proactive posts), advancing + persisting the cursor.
//!
//! Async by design (operator directive #370: the shared core is tokio, not thread-per-blocking-call); the
//! caller provides the runtime. The audio loop (cpal capture, sherpa STT/TTS) runs off that runtime on
//! blocking threads, but board I/O is async here. The methods are `async fn` over the shared
//! [`bridge_core::BoardClient`]; no runtime is pulled by this module itself.
