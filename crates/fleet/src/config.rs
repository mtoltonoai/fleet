//! `config` — TOML-file configuration for the fleet binary.
//!
//! Operator mandate seq-1377: the fleet binary is configured by a TOML file, not `FLEET_*` environment
//! variables. Every fleet-specific knob (tmux session, hub root, workspace root, board API base, launcher
//! path, this process's agent id) is read from the config here. The only environment still consulted is the
//! OS-standard `HOME`/`XDG_CONFIG_HOME` used to locate the config file (and as the workspace-root default) —
//! never a fleet knob. An absent config file or an absent key falls back to the same built-in default as the
//! pre-config binary, so a host with no config behaves exactly as before.
