//! `notify` — the fleet's event-driven wake injector (the P2 notification-wake, co-designed with
//! v-task-board; see ../../DESIGN.md).
//!
//! The board push-fires a best-effort HTTP POST to each agent's registered `webhook_url` for every inbox
//! event, carrying `recipient`, `type`, `task_id`, `event_seq`, … (never polling). Division of labor: the
//! board emits events; the FLEET owns the wake, because the wake target is a tmux window only the host with
//! tmux access can reach. So this is ONE long-running endpoint, registered as each board-backed agent's
//! `webhook_url`; on each POST it maps the event to a wake prompt and `tmux send-keys` injects it into the
//! recipient's window — `[notification] task #<task_id>` for a task assignment, `[notification] message
//! #<event_seq>` for a direct message — so the agent reacts to the event instead of polling.

/// SUBSCRIPTION = NOTIFICATION (operator directive, #386): if an agent is subscribed to a target it is woken
/// on that target's activity — comments included — and unsubscribe is the opt-out. So an event wakes the
/// recipient's live session when either (a) it is a direct-delivery type they cannot be a passive bystander
/// of — a `task.assigned` (new work), a `message.direct` (addressed to them), a `channel.post` (a channel
/// they are a member of) — or (b) it is a `task.commented` on a target the recipient has a DIRECT
/// subscription to (`subscribed == true`). A firehose-only recipient (present via a whole-board subscription,
/// not a direct one) is NOT woken on a comment — it accrues in the durable inbox for the next poll, so a
/// board-wide coordinator isn't woken on every ticket. Presence churn and the agent's own actions never wake.
/// Pure — unit-tested.
///
/// `subscribed` is the board's per-recipient hint (#384, superseding the earlier `actionable` field): `true`
/// when the recipient has a DIRECT subscription to this event's target, `false` when they are present only
/// via the whole-board firehose. It is what lets `task.commented` wake a collaborator — two agents conversing
/// on a task must not wait out each other's poll interval (the operator's zero-polling mandate) — while a
/// firehose bystander still drops to poll. This deliberately retires the #215 anti-FYI-drain gate (the
/// operator accepts the noise trade, with unsubscribe + auto-subscribe as the noise control). `task.assigned`
/// / `message.direct` / `channel.post` stay wake-on-type: their delivery already IS the subscription (a DM in
/// particular has no subscribable target), and keeping them type-gated also preserves their wake for a
/// pre-#384 payload that carries no `subscribed` field yet.
///
/// `reactive_unaddressed` narrows the wake for a REACTIVE relay/responder agent (task_580). A reactive agent
/// is a member/subscriber of the channels it bridges and the tasks it watches, so under subscription =
/// notification (#384) it is woken on EVERY ambient post/comment there — a full harness tick it correctly
/// concludes "no action" on, during live chatter it is not addressed in (the frank + v-slack-bridge evidence).
/// This flag suppresses the two AMBIENT-CAPABLE subscription wakes (`channel.post` and `task.commented`) for a
/// recipient that is reactive AND that the board says this event does NOT address (not an @mention of it, not
/// a reply in a thread it is engaged in). It never gates `task.assigned` / `message.direct` — those inherently
/// address the recipient. It defaults false (a non-reactive agent, or a board not yet sending the
/// reactive/addressed hints), so this is additive and dormant — identical to the pre-task_580 wake set until
/// the board opts a reactive agent in. The board owns the complementary half (do not auto-subscribe a
/// bridge-owner to the channels it bridges); the two together cut the waste at both the wake layer and the
