//! `board` — the bridge's client for the coordination board's **token-less localhost REST** surface.
//!
//! A bridge daemon runs OUTSIDE a Claude session, so it can't use the in-session board MCP tools — it uses
//! the board's plain REST API. Two directions:
//!
//! - **OUT (board → external)**: subscribe to the board-wide event firehose and act on [`OUTBOUND_REFLECT`]
//!   (`channel.outbound_reflect`) events. Per board-core #150, the board has ALREADY applied the outbound
//!   authz — the mere *existence* of the event IS the authorization, so the bridge reflects every one it
//!   sees to the mapped external channel and never re-checks direction/authors. The firehose is
//!   `GET /events?since_seq=<seq>&limit=<n>` (append-only, ascending `seq`; poll with the last seq seen).
//! - **IN (external → board)**: post an attributed message via `POST /channels/:id/posts` with the bridge's
//!   own agent id as `sender` and the external identity as `external_author` (`<source>:<id>`, board-core
//!   #149). Because the bridge agent isn't in the channel's `outbound_authors`, its own inbound posts don't
//!   echo back out as `channel.outbound_reflect` events (no loop).
//!
//! The HTTP methods are thin **async** wrappers over reqwest (operator directive #370: async I/O on tokio,
//! not a thread-per-blocking-call model — the caller provides the runtime); all PARSING/SHAPING is factored
//! into pure, sync functions ([`parse_events`], [`Event::as_outbound_reflect`], [`build_post_body`],
//! [`build_identity_body`], [`parse_channel_links`]) that are unit-tested without a network or a runtime.
