//! `echo` — board-origin marker so a bidirectional bridge doesn't re-ingest its own reflected posts (board
//! task #430, following an existing bot pattern).
//!
//! THE HAZARD: once the auto-relay runs continuously, a board-originated message reflected OUT to the
//! external channel is later read back by the inbound poller and re-posted to the board -> an infinite echo
//! loop. Message subtype / bot-id filtering is not enough: a `chat.postMessage` sent with a user token +
//! `username` override can come back on `conversations.history` looking like a plain user message (posted by
//! the token owner), with no `bot_id` to filter on.
//!
//! THE FIX: stamp EVERY board-origin outbound message with a per-bot identity marker — a `(<BotName> <emoji>)`
//! prefix and an `<emoji>` suffix — and have the inbound side DROP any message carrying it. The marker doubles
//! as a human-visible "this was posted by a bot" badge. The emoji is a deliberate carve-out from the fleet's
//! emoji ban (#368/#308), operator-granted for exactly this bot-identity marker.
//!
//! Detection is CONSERVATIVE: it matches the *structured* leading `(<name> <emoji>)` marker, not a bare emoji,
//! so a human message that merely happens to contain the emoji is never dropped. Pure + unit-tested.
//!
//! ROUND-TRIP NOTE (verified live against Slack, #430): Slack normalizes a posted unicode emoji to its
//! `:shortcode:` on read-back — a message posted as `(Frank 🤖) ... 🤖` comes back on `conversations.history`
//! as `(Frank :robot_face:) ... :robot_face:`. So detection must recognize BOTH forms: we POST the unicode
//! emoji (so it renders as a badge) but must DETECT the shortcode (what the inbound poller actually reads).

/// The reserved bridge-origin marker emoji, as POSTED (renders as the visible bot badge in the channel). A
/// human essentially never opens a message with the exact `(<name> <emoji>)` structure, so it's a safe sentinel.
pub const MARK_EMOJI: &str = "\u{1F916}"; // robot face
/// The same marker as Slack returns it on read-back: it normalizes the unicode emoji to this `:shortcode:`.
/// Detection matches either form so the bridge recognizes its own reflected posts coming back in.
