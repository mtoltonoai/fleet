# window.sh — the standalone fleet's tmux window launcher (generalized from cadenza's, multi-repo).
#
# The Rust `fleet` binary spawns a tmux window per agent and runs this inside it. This resolves the
# agent's config via `fleet describe` (KEY=VALUE lines), cd's into the agent's TARGET-REPO worktree, and
# launches `claude` with a role-aware kickoff. KEY DIFFERENCE from cadenza's window.sh: the TICK is NOT
# hardcoded with cadenza's "cargo xtask fleet sync + pr-sync" framing — the role body + the target repo's
# adapter govern how work is gated/landed. Comms are the standalone `fleet` binary on PATH (no repo
# checkout needed to talk to the hub — the hub is $FLEET_HUB / git-common-dir, resolved by the binary).

# task_347: GUARANTEE a known-good PATH for the agent process and every shell it spawns. A fleet agent's Bash
# tool-calls intermittently spawned with a stripped PATH (coreutils / git / curl / nix all "command not found",
# recoverable only via absolute /usr/bin/... paths) — a per-invocation tax seen across agents + days
# (corroborated). The tmux window can inherit a minimal/empty PATH from the launching daemon, and a tool shell
# that then fails to source a login profile has no usable PATH. APPENDING the standard system + nix-profile bin
# dirs here (before `exec claude`, so claude and all its child shells inherit it) makes the baseline PATH always
# complete while leaving any existing entries FIRST (a repo-/user-preferred tool still wins); the essentials are
# guaranteed present as a fallback, so a bare `git`/`curl`/`nix`/coreutil always resolves. A dir that does not
# exist on this host is harmless (the shell just skips it).
